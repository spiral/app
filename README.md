Spiral Framework is a High-Performance PHP/Go Full-Stack framework and group of over sixty PSR-compatible components. The Framework execution model based on a hybrid runtime where some services (GRPC, Queue, WebSockets, etc.) handled by Application Server [RoadRunner](https://github.com/spiral/roadrunner) and the PHP code of your application stays in memory permanently (anti-memory leak tools included).
